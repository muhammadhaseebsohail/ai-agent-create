Your code is correct, the unit test setup you provided is a standard way to test a login form using Jest and React Testing Library. It checks if the onLogin function is called with the correct parameters when the submit button is clicked. This test will ensure that the form is correctly capturing user inputs and passing them to the onLogin function. 

Here's the test code again:

```jsx
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Login from './Login';

test('calls onLogin with the username and password when the submit button is clicked', () => {
  const handleLogin = jest.fn();
  const { getByPlaceholderText, getByText } = render(<Login onLogin={handleLogin} />);

  fireEvent.change(getByPlaceholderText(/username/i), { target: { value: 'testuser' } });
  fireEvent.change(getByPlaceholderText(/password/i), { target: { value: 'testpass' } });

  fireEvent.click(getByText(/login/i));

  expect(handleLogin).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ username: 'testuser', password: 'testpass' });
});
```

This test:

1. Renders the Login component, passing a mock function as a prop for onLogin.
2. Simulates user input by firing change events on the username and password fields.
3. Simulates a click event on the Login button.
4. Checks if the mock onLogin function has been called with the correct parameters. 

To run this test, you would use the command `npm test` or `yarn test` in the terminal.
