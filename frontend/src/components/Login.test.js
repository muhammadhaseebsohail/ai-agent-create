The provided test setup looks good. It checks if the form renders correctly and if the onLogin function gets called with the correct parameters when the form is submitted.

One thing to note is that the test might fail because the getByLabelText method can't find the username and password inputs. This is because neither of these inputs have a label associated with them. In this case, it's better to use the getByPlaceholderText method:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Login from './Login';

test('renders login form', () => {
  const onLogin = jest.fn();
  const { getByPlaceholderText, getByText } = render(<Login onLogin={onLogin} />);

  const usernameInput = getByPlaceholderText(/username/i);
  const passwordInput = getByPlaceholderText(/password/i);
  
  fireEvent.change(usernameInput, { target: { value: 'testuser' } });
  fireEvent.change(passwordInput, { target: { value: 'testpassword' } });
  
  fireEvent.click(getByText(/login/i));
  
  expect(onLogin).toHaveBeenCalledWith('testuser', 'testpassword');
});
```

This test will now correctly simulate the user typing into the username and password fields and clicking the login button. It will then check if the onLogin function was called with the correct parameters.

In addition to this basic test, you might want to add more tests to cover other functionality of the component, such as error handling and the loading state.
