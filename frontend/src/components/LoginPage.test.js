You've already provided the complete component code, CSS styling, and PropTypes. The basic unit test setup has also been provided. 

Your unit test setup covers two important scenarios:

1. It checks if the component renders without crashing.
   
2. It simulates user interaction by filling in the form and submitting it, then checks if the `onLogin` callback is called.

This is a good starting point for testing this component. As your application grows, you might want to add more tests. For example, you could test if the error message displays when there's an error, or if the loading state is reflected in the UI. But for now, this is a solid setup. 

Remember that in real-world scenarios, you should mock actual network requests during testing to avoid making real requests, and to have control over the responses. Using a library like `jest-mock-axios` can be helpful for this.
