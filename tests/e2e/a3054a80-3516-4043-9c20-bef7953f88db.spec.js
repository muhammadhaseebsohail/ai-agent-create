Frontend Test Cases:

1. Unit Test with Jest and React Testing Library:
    - Test if the login component renders correctly
    - Test if the input fields (username and password) accept text input
    - Test if the submit button is disabled when the input fields are empty
    - Test if an error message is shown when invalid username or password is entered
    - Test if a successful login redirects to the homepage

2. End-to-End Test with Cypress:
    - Test if a user can successfully login with valid username and password and gets redirected to the homepage
    - Test if a user is prevented from logging in with invalid credentials
    - Test if a user is redirected to the login page when trying to access the homepage without logging in

Backend Test Cases:

1. Unit Test with pytest:
    - Test if the login endpoint is available
    - Test if the login endpoint responds with a token on successful login
    - Test if the login endpoint responds with an error message on incorrect username or password
    - Test if the login endpoint responds with an error message when the required fields are missing

2. Integration Test:
    - Test if the login API connects and interacts successfully with the database
    - Test if the user data is correctly validated before logging in
    - Test if the token generated after login is correctly stored for session management

3. Error Handling Test:
    - Test if the server returns appropriate error codes for different types of errors (400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized, etc.)
    - Test if the server handles exceptions and does not crash on errors

4. Performance Test:
    - Test the response time of the login API
    - Test the login functionality under high load conditions (many users trying to log in at the same time)
