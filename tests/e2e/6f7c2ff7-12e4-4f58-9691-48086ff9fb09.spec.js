    - Test that login button is disabled if username or password fields are empty
    - Test that an error message is displayed when invalid credentials are entered
    - Test that user is redirected to the homepage after successful login
    - Test that homepage renders correctly after successful login

2. **End-to-End Tests using Cypress**

Backend Tests:

1. **Unit Tests using pytest**

    - Test error scenarios for the login API endpoint (wrong credentials, empty fields)
    - Test that the session is correctly created after successful login
    - Test that the session is correctly destroyed after logout

2. **Integration Tests**
    - Test the integration between the login API endpoint and the user database
    - Test the integration between the session management and the rest of the application

3. **Performance Tests**
    - Test the response time of the login API endpoint
    - Test the load handling capability of the login API endpoint
    - Test the response time of the homepage API endpoint
    - Test the load handling capability of the homepage API endpoint

4. **Security Tests**
    - Test that user data is encrypted during transit
    - Test that stored passwords are hashed
    - Test that sessions are properly isolated
    - Test that the application is not vulnerable to SQL injection, XSS, or CSRF attacks
    - Test that brute force or dictionary attacks are mitigated (e.g., through rate limiting or account lockouts)
