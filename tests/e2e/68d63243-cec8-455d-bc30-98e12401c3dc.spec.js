Frontend Tests:

1. Unit Tests:

    a. With Jest and React Testing Library, we can write the following tests:

    - Test if the login form renders correctly.
    - Test if the signup form renders correctly.
    - Test if all the input fields in both forms are required; they should not submit if any field is empty.
    - Test if password fields are of type "password", ensuring that the password is hidden as it's being typed.
    - Test if a successful submission of the login/signup form redirects the user to the homepage.

2. End-to-End Tests:

    a. With Cypress or Playwright, we can write the following tests:

    - Test successful login: Enter valid credentials and check if the user is redirected to the homepage.
    - Test unsuccessful login: Enter invalid credentials and check if an error message is displayed.
    - Test successful signup: Enter valid details, submit the form, and check if the user is redirected to the homepage.
    - Test unsuccessful signup: Enter invalid or incomplete details, submit the form, and check if an error message is displayed.
    - Test if a user already logged in can access the login/signup page. They should be redirected to the homepage if they try to access these pages.

Backend Tests:

1. Unit Tests:

    a. With pytest, we can write the following tests:

    - Test if the password is being stored securely. The password should be hashed and not saved as plain text.
    - Test if the login function returns a token upon successful login.
    - Test if the signup function returns a token upon successful signup.

2. Integration Tests:

    a. With pytest, we can write the following tests:

    - Test the login API endpoint with valid credentials. It should return a token and a status code of 200.
    - Test the login API endpoint with invalid credentials. It should return an error message and a status code of 401 or 403.
    - Test the signup API endpoint with valid details. It should return a token and a status code of 201.
    - Test the signup API endpoint with invalid or incomplete details. It should return an error message and a status code of 400.

3. Performance Tests:

    a. With pytest, we can write the following tests:

    - Test the response time of the login/signup endpoints. The response time should be within acceptable limits, indicating that the system can handle the login/signup operations efficiently.
