Frontend Test Suite:

1. **User Registration**

    a. Unit Tests using Jest and React Testing Library

    - Test if the registration form renders correctly.
    - Test if input fields (email, password, confirm password) are functioning as expected.
    - Test the validation of the input fields.
    - Test if the submit button is disabled when the form is invalid or enabled when the form is valid.
    - Test if successful submission of the form leads to the correct API call.

    b. E2E Tests using Cypress

    - Test if the user can navigate to the registration page.
    - Test the successful registration flow: enter details -> submit -> successful message -> automatic login.
    - Test the unsuccessful registration flow: enter invalid details -> submit -> error message.
    - Test if the user is redirected to the login page after successful registration.

2. **User Login**

    a. Unit Tests

    - Test if the login form renders correctly.
    - Test if input fields (email, password) are functioning as expected.
    - Test the validation of the input fields.
    - Test if the submit button is disabled when the form is invalid or enabled when the form is valid.
    - Test if successful submission of the form leads to the correct API call.

    b. E2E Tests

    - Test if the user can navigate to the login page.
    - Test the successful login flow: enter details -> submit -> successful login -> redirect to the home page.
    - Test the unsuccessful login flow: enter invalid details -> submit -> error message.
    - Test if the user is redirected to the home page after successful login.

Backend Test Suite:

1. **User Registration**

    - Test if the endpoint is working as expected.
    - Test if the endpoint is accepting only POST requests.
    - Test the successful registration flow: send valid data -> receive 201 status code.
    - Test the unsuccessful registration flow: send invalid data -> receive 400 status code.
    - Test if the endpoint is correctly storing the user's data in the database.
    - Test if sending duplicate user data returns an error response.

2. **User Login**

    - Test if the endpoint is working as expected.
    - Test if the endpoint is accepting only POST requests.
    - Test the successful login flow: send valid data -> receive 200 status code and token.
    - Test the unsuccessful login flow: send invalid data -> receive 400 status code.
    - Test if sending non-existent user data returns an error response.

Performance Tests:

1. **User Registration**

    - Test the response time of the registration endpoint under normal load.
    - Test the response time of the registration endpoint under heavy load.

2. **User Login**

    - Test the response time of the login endpoint under normal load.
    - Test the response time of the login endpoint under heavy load.
