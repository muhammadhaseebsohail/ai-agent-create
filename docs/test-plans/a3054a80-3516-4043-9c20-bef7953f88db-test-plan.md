Test Plan Document

1. Test Objectives:
   - Verify that the login functionality is working as expected.
   - Confirm that the user is redirected to the homepage after successful login.
   - Ensure that the error handling is functioning correctly.
   - Validate that the system can handle edge cases properly.

2. Test Scope:
   - The scope of this test includes both frontend and backend testing.
   - For frontend, we'll conduct unit tests and E2E tests using Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress, or Playwright.
   - For backend, we'll perform unit tests, integration tests, and API tests using pytest.

3. Test Cases with Expected Results:
   - Test Case 1: Input valid username and password.
     Expected Result: User is logged in and redirected to the homepage.
   - Test Case 2: Input invalid username and password.
     Expected Result: User is not logged in. An error message is displayed.
   - Test Case 3: Leave both fields empty and try to login.
     Expected Result: User is not logged in. An error message is displayed.
   - Test Case 4: Input valid username and invalid password.
     Expected Result: User is not logged in. An error message is displayed.
   - Test Case 5: Input valid password and invalid username.
     Expected Result: User is not logged in. An error message is displayed.

4. Test Data Requirements:
   - A set of valid usernames and passwords.
   - A set of invalid usernames and passwords.
   - Special characters to test the robustness of the system.

5. Test Environment Setup:
   - Install and configure Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress or Playwright for frontend testing.
   - Install and configure pytest for backend testing.
   - Setup test database with mock data for testing.
   - Ensure the testing environment mirrors the production environment as close as possible to yield accurate test results.

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - The login functionality works correctly with valid inputs.
   - The system handles invalid inputs correctly by displaying appropriate error messages.
   - The user is redirected to the homepage after successful login.
   - The system does not allow login with invalid inputs.
   - The system handles edge cases without any breakdown. 

7. Best Practices for Test Organization:
    - Group similar types of tests together.
    - Clearly name tests and test files to indicate what they cover.
    - Make tests independent of each other, so they can run in any order.
    - Use setup and teardown methods to avoid duplication of code.
    - Keep tests small and focused on one particular aspect.
    - Test edge cases and unexpected behavior.
