Document Title: Test Plan - Login and Homepage Display

1. **Test Objectives**

The primary objective of this test is to evaluate the user's successful login and correct display of the homepage after login. This involves the testing of both frontend and backend components of the application. The frontend tests will focus on the UI/UX components whereas the backend tests will focus on API endpoints, data validation, error handling, and performance. 

2. **Test Scope**

This test will cover the following areas:

- User login interface and functionality
- Homepage display and functionality post-login
- Data validation and error handling during the login process

3. **Test Cases with Expected Results**

- **Test Case 1: Successful Login**
   
    _Steps_: 
    - Enter valid username
    - Enter valid password
    - Click on login button

    _Expected Result_: User is successfully logged in and redirected to the homepage.

- **Test Case 2: Unsuccessful Login - Invalid Credentials**
  
    _Steps_:
    - Enter invalid username
    - Enter invalid password
    - Click on login button

    _Expected Result_: Error message indicating invalid credentials is displayed.

- **Test Case 3: Homepage Display after Successful Login**
   
    _Steps_: 
    - Successfully log in
    - Verify the homepage display

    _Expected Result_: Homepage is correctly displayed with all necessary elements and functionalities.

4. **Test Data Requirements**

- Valid user credentials for successful login test cases
- Invalid user credentials for unsuccessful login test cases
- Expected homepage elements data for homepage display test cases

5. **Test Environment Setup**

- Frontend tests: Install and configure Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
- Backend tests: Install and configure pytest for Python/FastAPI tests.
- Ensure the application is hosted in a test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.

6. **Acceptance Criteria**

- All test cases pass, i.e., actual results match expected results.
- All edge cases and error scenarios are tested and pass.
- Test coverage is comprehensive, with a focus on both positive and negative scenarios.
- Performance of the login and homepage display process meets or exceeds the standard set by the development team.
