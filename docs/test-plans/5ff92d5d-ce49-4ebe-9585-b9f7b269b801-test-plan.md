1. Test Objectives:
    - Ensure that the User Registration feature works as expected, allowing users to create a new account with valid input data.
    - Ensure that the User Login feature works as expected, allowing users to login to their account with correct credentials.
    - Validate error handling for invalid input data and incorrect credentials.
    - Ensure the system's performance and response time are within acceptable limits.

2. Test Scope:
    - Frontend and Backend components of the User Registration and Login features.
    - Validation of input fields.
    - Error handling scenarios.
    - Performance testing.

3. Test Cases with Expected Results:

    For User Registration:
    - TC1: When the user enters all valid details, the system should create the account and the user should be redirected to the login page.
    - TC2: When the user enters an existing email, the system should display an error message.
    - TC3: When the user enters a weak password, the system should display an error message.
    - TC4: When the user leaves any required field empty, the system should display an error message.

    For User Login:
    - TC5: When the user enters valid credentials, the system should log the user in and redirect to the home page.
    - TC6: When the user enters an incorrect password, the system should display an error message.
    - TC7: When the user enters an email that doesn't exist, the system should display an error message.
    - TC8: When the user leaves any field empty, the system should display an error message.

4. Test Data Requirements:
    - User Registration: Valid and invalid user details including name, email, and password.
    - User Login: Valid and invalid credentials including email and password.

5. Test Environment Setup:
    - The testing will be carried out in a staging environment that replicates the production environment.
    - Frontend tests will use Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests and Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
    - Backend tests will use pytest for Python/FastAPI tests.
    - API Integration tests will be performed to validate the request and response.

6. Acceptance Criteria:
    - All the test cases should pass.
    - The system should handle all edge cases and error scenarios gracefully.
    - The system's performance and response time should be within acceptable limits.
    - The system should handle and validate all the input fields correctly.
    - The system should meet all the functional requirements.
