    - **Expected Result:** The user is redirected to the homepage

**4. Test Data Requirements**

No specific test data is required for this test plan as we are only testing navigation functionality.

**5. Test Environment Setup**

- The test will be conducted on a local development environment first and then on the staging environment.
- The latest version of the application should be deployed on the test environment.
- All the services that the application depends on should be up and running.
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and device sizes should be used for testing to ensure compatibility.

**6. Acceptance Criteria**

The redirection to the homepage functionality will be considered passed if:

- The user is correctly redirected to the homepage from any page within the application.
- The homepage content loads correctly after redirection.
- Appropriate error handling is in place for redirection failures.
- The response time for redirection is within acceptable limits. 

The test will be considered failed if any of the test cases do not produce the expected results.
