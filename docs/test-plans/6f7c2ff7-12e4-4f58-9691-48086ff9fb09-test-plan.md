Test Plan Document

1. Test Objectives:
   - To verify the functionality of the login and homepage.
   - To ensure the security of the login process.
   - To validate the accessibility and responsiveness of the homepage.
   - To check the performance of the login and homepage under different network conditions.

2. Test Scope:
   - Functional testing of the Login and Homepage.
   - Security testing of the Login process.
   - Performance testing of Login and Homepage.

3. Test Cases with Expected Results:
   - TC1: Verify that the user can log in with valid credentials. Expected Result: Successful login and redirection to the homepage.
   - TC2: Verify that the user cannot login with invalid credentials. Expected Result: An appropriate error message.
   - TC3: Verify that the homepage loads correctly after login. Expected Result: All elements of the homepage load correctly.
   - TC4: Verify that the user is logged out on clicking 'Logout'. Expected Result: User is redirected to the login page.
   - TC5: Check for SQL Injection in the login form. Expected Result: Login should not be successful and an appropriate error message should be displayed.
   - TC6: Verify that login page is served over HTTPS. Expected Result: URL should start with "https://".
   - TC7: Verify the load time of the homepage under different network conditions. Expected Result: Acceptable load times under different network conditions.

4. Test Data Requirements:
   - Valid and invalid usernames and passwords for login.
   - Different types of SQL Injection payloads.
   - Different network conditions for performance testing.

5. Test Environment Setup:
   - The application should be hosted on a test server.
