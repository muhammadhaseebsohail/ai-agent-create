# Test Plan Document 

## Task: Test the Login Functionality 

### 1. Test Objectives 

- To validate the login functionality.
- To ensure the user is able to login with valid credentials.
- To ensure the user is unable to login with invalid credentials.
- To validate error messages are displayed correctly for invalid inputs.
- To ensure the "Forgot Password" functionality works as expected.
- To validate the performance and response time of the login function.

### 2. Test Scope 

The test will cover the following:

- Unit tests for frontend and backend.
- Integration tests for frontend and backend.
- End-to-end tests for frontend.
- API integration tests for backend.
- Performance tests.

### 3. Test Cases with Expected Results 

#### Frontend Tests 

- TC01: Enter valid username and password -> Expect: User is logged in successfully.
- TC02: Enter invalid username and password -> Expect: Error message is displayed.
- TC03: Click "Forgot Password" -> Expect: User is redirected to reset password page.
- TC04: Leave username and password fields blank and click login -> Expect: Error message is displayed.
- TC05: Enter only username and click login -> Expect: Error message is displayed.
- TC06: Enter only password and click login -> Expect: Error message is displayed.

#### Backend Tests 

- TC07: Send POST request with valid credentials -> Expect: Receive 200 OK status and user data.
- TC08: Send POST request with invalid credentials -> Expect: Receive 401 Unauthorized status.
- TC09: Send POST request with missing credentials -> Expect: Receive 400 Bad Request status.
- TC10: Send POST request with invalid token -> Expect: Receive 403 Forbidden status.

### 4. Test Data Requirements 

- Valid and invalid usernames and passwords.
- Email addresses for password reset functionality.

### 5. Test Environment Setup 

- Frontend: Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests. Cypress for E2E tests.
- Backend: pytest for unit tests. Postman for API integration tests.
- Database: MongoDB or SQL (depending on the application).
- CI/CD: Jenkins or GitHub Actions for running the tests.

### 6. Acceptance Criteria 

The login functionality is considered fully tested and working as expected if:

- All test cases pass.
- Error messages are displayed correctly.
- "Forgot Password" functionality works as expected.
- Performance and response time are within acceptable limits.
- Test coverage is above 80% for both frontend and backend.
