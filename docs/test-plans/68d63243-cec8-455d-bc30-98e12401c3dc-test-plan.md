## Test Plan Document

### Task: Test the login and signup functionality

### 1. Test Objectives
- To validate successful and unsuccessful login/signup scenarios.
- To ensure the secure storage of user passwords.
- To confirm correct redirection to the homepage after successful login/signup.

### 2. Test Scope
- Frontend: Test the user interface for login and signup functionality, validation, response time, and redirection. 
- Backend: Test API endpoints, data validation, secure password storage, error handling, and response time.

### 3. Test Cases with Expected Results

#### Frontend:

- **TC1:** User should be able to enter login details and click on the login button. The expected result is successful user login and redirection to the homepage.
- **TC2:** User should be able to enter signup details and click on the signup button. The expected result is successful user registration and redirection to the homepage.
- **TC3:** User should not be able to login with incorrect login details. The expected result is the display of an appropriate error message.
- **TC4:** User should not be able to signup with a username or email that is already in use. The expected result is the display of an appropriate error message.
- **TC5:** User should not be able to signup with mismatched password and confirm password fields. The expected result is the display of an appropriate error message.

#### Backend:

- **TC6:** Test API endpoint for successful user login. The expected result is a successful HTTP response and user data.
- **TC7:** Test API endpoint for unsuccessful user login. The expected result is an error HTTP response with an appropriate message.
- **TC8:** Test API endpoint for successful user signup. The expected result is a successful HTTP response and user data.
- **TC9:** Test API endpoint for unsuccessful user signup. The expected result is an error HTTP response with an appropriate message.
- **TC10:** Test secure storage of user passwords. The expected result is that the passwords are stored in a hashed or encrypted format.

### 4. Test Data Requirements

- Test user data for login and signup (both valid and invalid data for positive and negative testing).

### 5. Test Environment Setup

- Frontend: Setup a local development environment, install Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests, and Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
- Backend: Setup a local development environment, install pytest for Python/FastAPI tests.

### 6. Acceptance Criteria

- All edge cases are handled.
- Error messages are displayed correctly.
- Successful redirection to the homepage after login/signup.
- Passwords are securely stored.
- Test coverage is above 85%.
