In the provided code, the Pydantic models `User` and `UserInDB` have been already declared. The `User` model is used for request objects and `UserInDB` is used for response objects. 

The `User` model includes the fields `username` and `content`, where `content` is optional. The `UserInDB` model inherits from `User` and adds an `id` field, which is unique for every user.

```python
# Pydantic Models
class User(BaseModel):
    username: str = Field(...)
    content: Optional[str] = Field(None)

class UserInDB(User):
    id: int
```

The `UserInDB` model is used as the response model in the `read_user_content` endpoint. FastAPI takes care of request validation and serialization/deserialization using Pydantic models.

If we were to have an endpoint for creating a user, it would look something like this:

```python
@app.post("/user", response_model=UserInDB)
def create_user(user: User, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    """
    Create a new user
    """
    try:
        db_user = UserDB(**user.dict())
        db.add(db_user)
        db.commit()
        db.refresh(db_user)
        return db_user
    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to create user: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Failed to create user.")
```

In this endpoint, the `User` model is used as a request body for creating a user. Pydantic automatically validates the data and raises a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response if the data is not valid.

For this endpoint, a unit test would look like:

```python
def test_create_user():
    client = TestClient(app)
    response = client.post("/user", json={"username": "testuser", "content": "testcontent"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "username" in response.json()
    assert "content" in response.json()
    assert "id" in response.json()
    assert response.json()["username"] == "testuser"
    assert response.json()["content"] == "testcontent"
```

This test checks whether the API endpoint is returning a 200 status code and the correct fields in the response. It also checks whether the returned data matches the data sent in the request.
