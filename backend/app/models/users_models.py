The Pydantic models for request and response have already been included in the previous response under the section "Next, we will need Pydantic models for handling our request/response data". Here they are again for your reference:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserBase(BaseModel):
    username: str

class UserCreate(UserBase):
    password: str

class UserInDB(UserBase):
    id: int
    hashed_password: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

In this code, UserBase is the base model, which includes only a username. UserCreate extends UserBase and includes a password, and it's used when creating a new user. UserInDB extends UserBase, includes an ID and a hashed_password, and represents users stored in the database.

For this case, the data transfer objects are the instances of these models. They are used to transfer data between different parts of the system, such as the database and the API endpoints.

For example, when a new user is created, an instance of UserCreate is received from the API request, and an instance of UserInDB is returned in the response. The UserService class uses both of these models to handle the business logic of creating a new user.
