The request and response models would be the Pydantic models defined above. They are used for data validation and serialization/deserialization. The UserCreate model is used as the request model for the POST /users/ endpoint, and the User model is used as the response model.

Here are those models again for reference:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class UserBase(BaseModel):
    """
    Base user model with common attributes
    """
    email: str

class UserCreate(UserBase):
    """
    Request model for creating a new user
    
    Attributes:
    password: str - The password for the new user
    """
    password: str

class User(UserBase):
    """
    Response model for user
    
    Attributes:
    id: int - The ID of the user
    is_active: bool - Whether the user is active or not
    """
    id: int
    is_active: bool

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
``` 

The UserCreate model inherits from UserBase to include the email field. This model also includes a password field, which is needed to create a new user but is not included in the response for security reasons.

The User model also inherits from UserBase, and it includes two additional fields: id and is_active. This model is used as the response model, so it includes all the data that should be returned when a user is created.

These Pydantic models are used as data transfer objects (DTOs) between different parts of the application. The UserCreate model carries data from the client to the server when a new user is created, and the User model carries data from the server to the client when a user is returned in a response.
