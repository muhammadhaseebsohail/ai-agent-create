In your code, you have already used the `BaseModel` class from the Pydantic module to create data models. However, you are missing the models for the `Token` and the `Signup` request. Let's fix this:

The `Token` model could be as follows:

```python
class Token(BaseModel):
    access_token: str
    token_type: str
```

The `Signup` request model should take a `username` and `password` parameters:

```python
class Signup(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
```

Now, the API endpoints need to use these models:

The `/token` endpoint is already using the `Token` model:

```python
@app.post("/token", response_model=Token)
def login_for_access_token(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    ...
```

The `/signup` endpoint should use the `Signup` model:

```python
@app.post("/signup")
def signup(signup_request: Signup):
    username = signup_request.username
    password = signup_request.password
    ...
```

Also, you should create a `User` model for responses when creating a user:

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
```

And use it in the `/signup` endpoint:

```python
@app.post("/signup", response_model=User)
def signup(signup_request: Signup):
    username = signup_request.username
    password = signup_request.password
    ...
    return {"username": username, "password": hashed_password}
```

Now, when a new user is created, the response will include the username and the hashed password. This is just an example. In a real-world application, you wouldn't want to return the hashed password in the response. You should replace it with a message indicating that the user was created successfully or with other relevant data.
